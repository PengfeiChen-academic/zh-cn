**Research Highlights:**

**High-Performance TENGs:** Developed ultra-robust, high-power-density Triboelectric nanogenerators for self-powered marine IoT systems. (Energy Environ. Sci., Adv. Mater.) 

**Breakthrough Strategies:** Pioneered "Double charge supplement" and "rationally segmented electrode" designs to achieve constant power output, low wear and record durability (Adv. Energy Mater., Energy Environ. Sci.).  

**Biomimetic & Sustainable Systems:** Created bionic whiskers for robotic tactile sensing, biodegradable, flame-retardant all-cellulose-based TENGs for smart monitoring, flexible power fabrics for wireless wearable electronics (Adv. Mater., J. Mater. Chem. A).

**Integrated Energy Solutions:** Designed independently universal, efficient charge management circuits to improve the charging speed by more than 100 times and developed ultralow powered discharge management circuits for constructing fully self-powered micro/nano energy harvesting and application system. (Adv. Mater., Adv. Energy Mater.)



**Research topics:**
